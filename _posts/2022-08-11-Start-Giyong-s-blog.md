Hello world!! Finally I made my own Blog site thanks to the Github!

Stay tuned, I decided to achieve my green playground! 1 day 1 commit I'll keep commiting on over 3 month, That is my goal by now!



Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
